      <p><strong>Aim:</strong> To determine the grating element by using the diffraction pattern of He-Ne Laser.</p>
      <p><strong>Apparatus:</strong> He-Ne Laser, grating, single slit, screen, scale, etc.</p>

            <h2>THEORY:</h2>
            <p>The term LASER is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
			A laser is a device that amplifies and generates light. It is an artificial light source and emits light that covers
			an extremely limited range of visible, infrared, or ultraviolet wavelengths. Laser has the potential to show its applications
			in various fields like medicine to communications. Laser is based on the concept of amplification of light by stimulated emission 
			of radiation by matter. Einstein predicted this possibility of stimulated emission in 1917 but the first laser was built by T.A. Maiman 
			in 1960.</p>
			<p>In this experiment, the grating element of a diffraction grating is determined using the diffraction pattern of a He-Ne Laser.</p>
			<p>A diffraction grating is an arrangement of a large number of parallel slits of the same width, separated by equal opaque spaces.
			It is made by ruling a large number of equidistant parallel straight lines on glass, so that there are alternate transparent & opaque
			spaces on it. A diamond pointer is used to rule the lines. A photographic replica of a plate, made by this method, is also used as a 
			grating. When a plane wave front of monochromatic light is incident normally on a grating every point in each slit acts as a source
			of secondary wavelets spreading in all directions. The central maximum is formed, where the secondary wavelets traveling in the same
			direction as that of the incident light are brought to focus. At any other point, where the rays travel with an inclination with respect
			to the Incident light, the waves reach it in different phases. As a result, dark & bright bands are formed on either side of the central
			maximum.</p>
			<p>Condition for the formation of maxima at a point is that, the path difference between the waves reaching at a point must be an integral
			multiple of the wavelength.</p>
			<p>(a+b)sinθ=nλ</p>
			<p>where,</p>
			<p>(a+b)=grating element</p>
			<p>a=width of slit</p>
			<p>b=distance between two adjacent slits</p>
			<p>n=order of the spectrum</p>
			<p>For very small θ,sinθ=θ</p>
			<p>(a+b)θ=±nλ</p>
			<p>From right angle triangle ABC in Fig.1,</p>
			<p>θ=x/f hence (a+b)x/f=±nλ</p>
			<p>This is the formula to determine the grating element</p>

            <h2>PROCEDURE:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li> A plane transmission grating is adjusted upright next to laser. A screen is mounted next to the grating</li>
                <li> The laser is switched on. The relative orientation of laser with respect to the grating is adjusted such that spectral
				spots are observed on the screen. </li>
                <li> The position of the screen is adjusted to obtain diffraction pattern on the screen. 
				The central maxima and other maxima are identified.</li>
                <li> The position 'x' of the spot for different orders on either side of central maximum and first order maximum & 
				first order maxima is measured on either side. The readings are noted in observation table.</li>
                <li> The above procedure is repeated for other orders.</li>
                <li> The distance 'f' between the grating and screen is noted. By using the formula number of lines per cm can be calculated.</li>
