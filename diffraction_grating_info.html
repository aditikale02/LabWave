        <h1>Diffraction Grating - 1</h1>
        
        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p><strong>1.</strong> To demonstrate the phenomenon of diffraction of light with a diffraction grating.</p>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> To determine the wavelength of different colours of light by a diffraction grating.</p>
        
        <h2>Apparatus</h2>
        <p>Spectrometer, source of light (mercury lamp), diffraction grating, magnifying lenses, etc.</p>
        
        <h2>Prior Concepts</h2>
        <p>Diffraction, maxima & minima of intensity.</p>
        
        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>Spectroscopy is a powerful research technique in Physics. It is useful for production, observation, analysis and interpretation of the spectra of given sources. The properties of a spectral source can be studied by calculating parameters like intensity, line width and wavelengths of the spectral lines. Spectroscopy has been found applicable in determination of atomic and molecular structures and energy levels, study of interatomic and intermolecular interactions, identification of elements, identification of chemical compositions of unknown substances and their physical properties, etc.

            Verification of Bhor's model of the atom has been made possible due to spectroscopic analysis. Spectroscopy is also an important research tool in Astrophysics where it is used for studying the compositions of planets and stars, their atmosphere, as well as their physical properties like pressure, density, temperature, etc. The fact that the sun is composed of 65% helium and 35% hydrogen has been discovered using spectroscopic analysis.
            
            The aim of the experiment is one of the basic tasks in spectroscopy, le., the determination of the wavelength of spectral lines. 
            
            The distribution of dispersed radiated energy arranged periodically according to certain parameters like energy, frequency, wavelength, etc., is called the spectrum. The source can be made to emit the radiation by suitably exciting it by direct or electrical heating. The excited atoms re-emit the absorbed energy while returning to the ground state. This radiated energy can be converted into a spectrum using the spectrometer, which is an instrument used to produce, observe and analyse the spectrum of a given source.
            
            Spectrometer consists of a telescope & collimator; both being mounted on a rigid stand. The collimator is fixed & the telescope is rigidly attached to an arm which rotates about the centre of the stand. At the centre of the instrument, is a prism table provided with screws for levelling. Underneath the prism table is a metal scale graduated in degrees, on which the positions of the telescope can be read.
            
            The bending of any kind of wave when encountered by any obstacle of dimension comparable to its wavelength is called diffraction.
            
           
            A diffraction grating is an arrangement of a large number of parallel slits of the same width, separated by equal opaque spaces. It is made by ruling a large number of equidistant parallel straight lines on glass, so that there are alternate transparent & opaque spaces on it.</p>
        
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust the telescope and collimator for parallel rays using Schuster's method.</li>
            <li>Mount the diffraction grating on the turntable such that its plane is perpendicular to the turntable.</li>
            <li>Arrange the face of the grating so that it lies normal to the collimator.</li>
            <li>Focus the vertical cross-wire of the eyepiece perfectly on the first (violet) line of the first-order spectrum on the left side.</li>
            <li>Clamp the telescope and note its angular position using the angular scale.</li>
            <li>Similarly, take readings for the other lines of the spectrum.</li>
            <li>Turn the telescope to the right side and take readings for the first-order spectrum on this side.</li>
            <li>Calculate values for each color using the given formulae.</li>
            <li>Compare results with standard values and calculate deviation.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>Formulae</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Wavelength calculation:</strong></p>
        <p>(a + b) * sin(θ) = ± nλ</p>
        <p>For first-order spectrum, n = 1:</p>
        <p><strong>λ = (a + b) * sin(θ)</strong></p>
        <p><strong>2. Percentage deviation:</strong></p>
        <p>% Deviation = [(λ_exp - λ_std) / λ_std] × 100%</p>
