        <h1>Newton's Ring - 2</h1>

        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To determine the radius of curvature of a plano-convex lens using the phenomenon of Newton's rings.</p>

        <h2>Apparatus</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Glass plate</li>
            <li>Plano-convex lens</li>
            <li>Sodium lamp</li>
            <li>Lens</li>
            <li>Travelling microscope</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Theory</h2>
        <p>
            The modification in the distribution of intensity of light in the region of superposition when two or more waves superimpose is called interference. In a thin wedge-shaped film, the interference pattern consists of alternate dark and bright straight bands parallel to the thin edge of the wedge. For a particular order of maxima & minima, the thickness of the film remains constant.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a plano-convex lens is placed over a glass plate, a thin wedge-shaped film is formed between the two glass surfaces. When illuminated by a beam of monochromatic light, interference occurs between the rays reflected from the lower surface of the lens and the upper surface of the glass plate (i.e., top and bottom surfaces of the air film). The interference pattern forms circular fringes, which are the locus of points of constant air film thickness.
        </p>
        <p>
            The surfaces of the lens and the glass plate should be perfectly clean. The glass plate should be optically flat, and the curved surface of the plano-convex lens must be perfectly spherical to observe clear circular rings. Newton's rings pattern observed in reflected light has a dark center because the lens and the plane glass plate touch at that position, making the air film thickness zero.
        </p>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <div class="procedure">
            <ol>
                <li>Arrange the apparatus as shown in the figure. Clean the lens and glass plate thoroughly, then place the plano-convex lens on the glass plate with its convex surface touching the plate. Place it below the microscope.</li>
                <li>Allow parallel light from a sodium lamp to fall on a glass plate held at 45° to the horizontal so that the reflected light falls upon the lens. Adjust the microscope so that the point of contact is just below the microscope objective. Focus until the rings are distinctly visible, with the center of the ring system lying below the cross wires. Rotate the eyepiece so that one cross wire is perpendicular to the horizontal scale.</li>
                <li>Move the microscope across the field of vision and focus on a distinct dark ring (e.g., the 20th dark ring from the center on the left). Read the position of the microscope with the cross wire tangential to the ring. Continue focusing on successive dark rings in steps of two until reaching dark ring number 4.</li>
                <li>Move the microscope across the center until it focuses on the other end of the diameter of dark ring number 4. Read the position and proceed to the 20th dark ring on the right. Determine the diameters (Dn) of the rings from the set of readings.</li>
                <li>Calculate the diameters (D) and plot a graph of D<sup>2</sup> vs. ring number.</li>
                <li>Calculate the slope of the straight line and, using the wavelength of sodium light, determine the radius of curvature of the plano-convex lens using the formula:
                    <br><strong>R = (μ(Dm² - Dn²)) / (4 × λ × (m - n))</strong>
                </li>
